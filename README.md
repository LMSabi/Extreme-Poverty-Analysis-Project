# Data Source
## Summary
The data [“Data on Poverty by the World Bank Poverty and Inequality Platform”](https://github.com/owid/poverty-data#a-global-dataset-of-poverty-and-inequality-measures-prepared-by-our-world-in-data-from-the-world-banks-poverty-and-inequality-platform-pip-database) is from the world bank’s poverty and inequality platform database and further cleaned and prepared by Our World in Data. The World Bank is an official and trustworthy source. It is a collection of survey data from household surveys where the World Bank has taken further steps to normalize the results across different countries.
The data is broken up by country, year, reporting level (national, urban or rural), household income or consumption expenditure, survey year and different measures of poverty and inequality, such as: \ 
% of population living in households with an income or expenditure per person below different $ amounts a day \
the average shortfall from the International Poverty Line per day, the mean level of income or expenditure per day \
the Gini index \
the polarization index \
the Palma ratio \

## Explanation for choosing the data set
I chose the data set because I think it offers interesting insights in the relationship between poverty and inequality. 
## Data Profile
Limitations and ethical considerations
Because there is no global survey of incomes, available national surveys are used. These national surveys are partially designed with cross-country comparability in mind, but they do have differences that come from the differing circumstances and priorities in the different countries. One of these differences is that the database mostly contains income for high-income countries while poorer countries mostly are represented by people’s consumption expenditure. The relationship between these values is that a household’s income is made up of its consumption plus any savings and minus borrowing or spending out of savings.
